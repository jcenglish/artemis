Artemis

Artemis is a podcast streaming and recommendation app created by Soheila Bayat, Funmi Ojo, Jillian McLaren and Jasmine English. It is available at ArtemisPlayer.com.

We built Artemis using React and Redux on the frontend and Node.js, Postgres, Sequelize and Express on the backend. We sourced the podcast data from the ListenNotes API, which gave us access to information on over 550,000 podcasts.
